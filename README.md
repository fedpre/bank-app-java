# Overview
The "Bank Account App" is an application developed in Java with the purpose to keep track of the transactions that occur in a bank account. 

The user can create a new bank account or open a previously created one. The information of a new bank account will be stored in a CSV file along with the transaction history.


The app has a UI that allows the user to easily navigate and perform actions on the bank account. The operations allowed are "withdraw" and "deposit." 

The user can decide to delete the bank account and all its information. 

The purpose of this project is to show proficiency in Java regarding:
* Variables
* Expressions
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Functions
* Classes
* Data Structures from Java Collection Framework
* Read and write to a file
* Use of external libraries 
* The use of inheritance (extends)
* The use of an interface (impements)
* The creationg of UI from JavaFX
* Object-oriented design pattern for creating efficient software

The UI has been created with JavaFX. I have implemented several FXML files to lay the structure of the page and CSS-styling. The button actions are handled by controller classes that allows interactivity between the user and the back end of the application. 

Below is provided a Demo Video for the functionalities of the app and a walkthrough of the code:

# Future Work
* Ability to create multiple bank accounts associated with the same user
* The functionality for a user to login and only access his bank accounts
* Sort the transactions from newest to oldest
* Make the tabular view wider to fit more information
* Better styling for the background, text, etc.
